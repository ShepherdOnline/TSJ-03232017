Here's an event taking place this weekend for a couple of our students: Kayla Morgan and Angelina Myers will be competing at the Michigan State Figure Skating Championships this weekend in Rochester. The ladies will be representing both Shepherd High School and the Middle of the Mitt High School Team. Competition will be held on Saturday \(individual events\) and Sunday \(team\).

Best wishes.
