## SMS Spring Spirit Week Schedule {#sms-spring-spirit-week-schedule}

We will be having SPRING SPIRIT WEEK next week (Monday, March 27 to Friday, March 31)! Themes for the days are as follows:

*   Monday: Comfy Day - wear pajamas or sweats and just be comfortable!
*   Tuesday: Spring Colors Day - wear pastels or bright colors!
*   Wednesday: Wacky Wednesday - crazy hair and/or mismatched clothes...go for it!
*   Thursday: Dress Your Best OR Grunge Day - students can choose between dress clothes or baggy jeans and flannel shirts!
*   Friday: Character Day - students can dress like or wear t-shirts announcing their favorite character, whether it be a Disney character, Peanuts character, superhero, or another story character.

As always, clothes should be school appropriate. We encourage students to join in the fun!
